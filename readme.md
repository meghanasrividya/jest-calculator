## Installation

To get started, you need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/meghanasrividya/jest-calculator.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd jest-calculator

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Usage

You can use the calculator functions by requiring the `calculator.js` module in your project. Below is an example of how to use the functions:

```javascript
const { add, subtract, multiply, divide } = require('./calculator');

console.log('Addition of 2 and 3:', add(2, 3));          // 5
console.log('Subtraction of 5 from 10:', subtract(10, 5)); // 5
console.log('Multiplication of 2 and 5:', multiply(2, 5)); // 10
console.log('Division of 6 by 2:', divide(6, 2));          // 3
```

## Testing

This project uses Jest for unit testing. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

The test cases for the calculator functions are defined in the `calculator.test.js` file. The tests cover various scenarios, including edge cases like division by zero.
